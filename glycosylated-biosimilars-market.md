<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Glycosylated Biosimilars Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>mAb</li><li>EPO</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The glycosylated biosimilars market primarily consists of two significant types: monoclonal antibodies (mAb) and erythropoietin (EPO) biosimilars. mAb biosimilars replicate the complex glycosylation patterns of original antibodies, enabling similar therapeutic effects for conditions like cancer and autoimmune disorders. EPO biosimilars, designed to mimic the naturally occurring hormone responsible for red blood cell production, are used in treating anemia, particularly in chronic kidney disease. Both types demonstrate regulatory challenges and opportunities for improved patient access and healthcare savings.</p></p>
